Workstation Standardization:

A) Standardized Environment - A standardized workstation environment will be set up: Clock, taskbar and other settings configure for all users
  1) Taskbar: All taskbar settings are locked, users can’t resize, move or rearrange the taskbar, they also lose access to the taskbar control panel, this way all employees share the same taskbar and wallpaper. We also disabled all balloon notifications and future   advertisement balloon notifications. 


B) Company-wide Wallpapers - Company-wide wallpapers will be deployed to all workstations
  1) Wallpaper: All SecureEdge Inc. employees share the same wallpaper with SecureEdge Inc. logo.
