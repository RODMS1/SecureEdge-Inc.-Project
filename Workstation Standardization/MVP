Wallpaper: All SecureEdge Inc. employees share the same wallpaper.

Taskbar: All taskbar settings are locked, users can’t resize, move or rearrange the taskbar, they also lose access to the taskbar control panel, this way all employees share the same taskbar and wallpaper. 
We also disabled all balloon notifications and future advertisement balloon notifications.
